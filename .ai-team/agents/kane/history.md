# Kane — History

## Project Learnings (from import)
- **Project:** hlx — Helix Test Infrastructure CLI & MCP Server
- **User:** Larry Ewing (lewing@microsoft.com)
- **Stack:** C# .NET 10, ConsoleAppFramework, ModelContextProtocol, Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Client
- **README.md** exists with Quick Start, MCP Tools table, Project Structure, Requirements
- **llmstxt command** exists in Program.cs — prints CLI documentation for LLM agents
- **MCP tool descriptions** are in HelixMcpTools.cs via [Description] attributes
- **XML doc comments** exist on CLI commands and HelixService class

## Core Context (summarized through 2026-02-27)

**Documentation infrastructure:**
- llmstxt and README are the authoritative docs — when new commands or MCP tools are added, both must be updated together
- llmstxt uses `var text = """..."""; Console.Write(text);` raw string literal pattern (flush-left output)
- Key naming: **package** = `lewing.helix.mcp`, **repo** = `helix.mcp`, **CLI command** = `hlx`
- When configs differ only by path/key, use ONE canonical example + table (not duplicated blocks)
- `--yes` flag required on all `dnx` args in MCP server configs (non-interactive launch)
- MCP is default mode when no subcommand given
- Mermaid diagrams render natively on GitHub — keep focused on one story per diagram
- README intro pattern: what-it-is subtitle → "Why?" section with problem + value props (bold label bullets)
- Cache docs: settings table + bold-label bullets — concise, scannable
- HTTP auth: subsection under Authentication (extends existing auth story)
- Security section: bullet list with **bold label:** prefix per item
- MCP descriptions describe what/inputs/outputs, not implementation details

**Documentation sessions completed (13 total):**
- docs-fixes, mcp-stdio-docs, shipped-features-docs, new-features-docs, install-section-rework, dnx-zero-install, package-rename, readme-consolidation, readme-audit, stale-hlx-refs, cli-examples-hlx, cache-mermaid-diagram, readme-v013-update, readme-intro-rewrite, team-md-public, value-add-audit, enhancements-section, llmstxt-missing-tools, readme-comprehensive-update

**Key files:**
- HelixMcpTools.cs consolidated into HelixTool.Core — discovered via `typeof(HelixMcpTools).Assembly`
- Tool packaged as dotnet tool: `<PackAsTool>true</PackAsTool>`, `<ToolCommandName>hlx</ToolCommandName>`
- HLX_API_KEY gates HTTP server (ApiKeyMiddleware), separate from HELIX_ACCESS_TOKEN (Helix API auth)
- hlx_find_files is generalized; hlx_find_binlogs delegates with `*.binlog` pattern
- README references MIT license but no LICENSE file exists

**Remaining docs gaps:** HelixIdResolver XML docs, HelixMcpTools class-level doc comment, LICENSE file missing, llmstxt had missing tools (fixed 2025-07-18).
