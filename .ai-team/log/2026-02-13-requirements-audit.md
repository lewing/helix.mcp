## Summary

Ash audited all 30 user stories against the codebase and updated requirements.md.

## Results

- 25 of 30 stories marked as ✅ Implemented (all P0s, all P1s, 8 of 9 P2s)
- 7 acceptance criteria gaps identified with explanatory notes
- US-22 (structured test failure parsing) is the only P2 not fully done — `hlx_search_log` exists but the structured `hlx_test_failures` tool was never built
- All 8 original implementation gaps resolved
- Feature table updated from 7 to 15 capabilities
- Requirements document now accurately reflects project maturity
