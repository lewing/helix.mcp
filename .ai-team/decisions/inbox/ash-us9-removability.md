### 2025-07-18: US-9 Script Removability Analysis Complete
**By:** Ash
**What:** Completed comprehensive function-by-function mapping of ci-analysis Helix API code to hlx equivalents. All 6 core API functions (152 lines) are 100% replaceable. Overall Helix-related coverage is ~85% (217/305 extended lines). Phase 1 migration can proceed immediately with zero blockers — net reduction of ~120 lines. Only meaningful gap is structured test failure extraction (US-22, P2, ~88 lines at ~40% coverage). Analysis delivered at `.ai-team/analysis/us9-script-removability.md`.
**Why:** This analysis is the prerequisite for ci-analysis adopting hlx. Without quantified coverage and a gap list, the migration plan was aspirational. Now it's actionable: the team knows exactly which functions to replace, which to keep, and which user stories (if any) to promote. The key finding — that NO user stories need promotion for Phase 1 — means migration can start in the next sprint.
