### 2025-07-21: CI workflow added at .github/workflows/ci.yml
**By:** Ripley
**What:** Created a GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs on push/PR to main/master. Matrix: ubuntu-latest + windows-latest. Uses .NET 10 preview SDK. Steps: checkout, restore, build, test. NuGet restore uses the repo-root nuget.config which already includes the dotnet-eng Azure Artifacts feed.
**Why:** The project had no CI. This gives us build+test validation on every PR and push to main branches, on both Linux and Windows, matching the cross-platform nature of the tool.
