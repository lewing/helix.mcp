### 2026-02-13: US-6 Download E2E Verification
**By:** Lambert
**What:** Created 46 comprehensive tests for DownloadFilesAsync and DownloadFromUrlAsync in `DownloadTests.cs`, organized into 4 test classes: DownloadFilesTests (27), DownloadFromUrlParsingTests (5), DownloadSanitizationTests (6), DownloadPatternTests (8). All 298 tests pass.
**Why:** Download commands had zero test coverage. Tests verify happy paths (single/multi-file, pattern matching, binary content), security (path traversal via `..`, `/`, `\` — all sanitized by CacheSecurity), error handling (401/403/404/timeout/cancellation), input validation, and edge cases (empty streams, unicode filenames, same-name files, URL-encoded characters). Each test class uses a distinct ValidJobId GUID to prevent temp directory collisions during parallel xUnit execution — a pattern discovered when shared GUIDs caused file contention failures.
